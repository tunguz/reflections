When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I am traveling. That could be very useful

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to go through more small sacel comitts before you choose to push those comitts to the server.
